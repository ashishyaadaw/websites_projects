          At RPM Academy, our aim is to provide an enriching curriculum in a
          conducive learning environment that will prepare students for success
          while at academy and for the years beyond academy. While we accord

          holistic development of our students by achieving a balance between
          the academic, physical and artistic pursuits. We are committed to
          prepare students for the challenges of the 21st century. <br></br>
